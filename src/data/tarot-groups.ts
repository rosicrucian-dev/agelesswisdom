/**
 * The eight "Tarot Groups" from Tarot Instruction 2, Supplement 1 — the data
 * behind both renderings of the tableau: the web component
 * (src/components/tarot-groups.tsx) and the print renderer
 * (scripts/print/render.ts). One table, so the two can never disagree.
 *
 * The 112 nine-Key combinations fall into eight groups of fourteen. Each group
 * is one of the eight symmetries of the square (the dihedral group D4) applied
 * to a basic 3x3 arrangement of nine consecutive Keys. Grid k (k = 1..14) holds
 * the nine consecutive numbers k-1 .. k+7; the offset matrix for each group
 * fixes which of those numbers sits in each cell. Deriving the grids rather than
 * transcribing them keeps every one of the 112 arrangements provably correct
 * (the printed tables are the source of truth and were verified against these).
